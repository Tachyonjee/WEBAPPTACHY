# Tachyon Institute Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive full-stack management system for "Tachyon Institute of Science" integrating Visitor Management, Admissions, Academics, Gamification, and Role-Based Dashboards into a unified ecosystem. Built with Flask backend, PostgreSQL database, and API-first design for both web and mobile applications.

## Architecture Status (100% Complete - TACHYON INSTITUTE LIVE)
### ✅ Completed Features
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Flask app with proper routing, blueprints, and database models
- **Authentication System**: OTP-based authentication for students, password auth for staff
- **Database Models**: 15+ models covering users, questions, attempts, gamification, etc.
- **Question Management**: CRUD operations, bulk upload via CSV/XLSX, filtering
- **Practice System**: Adaptive question delivery, multiple practice modes, session tracking
- **Gamification**: Points, streaks, badges, performance analytics
- **Student Features**: Bookmarks, doubts, progress tracking, personalized recommendations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Student, operator, mentor, admin roles
- **Modern Frontend Architecture**: PWA support, interactive JavaScript, responsive design
- **Progressive Web App**: Service worker, offline support, installable app
- **Interactive Practice Sessions**: Real-time question handling, timer, animations
- **Charts & Analytics**: Chart.js integration for performance visualization
- **Comprehensive API Layer**: Centralized API client with error handling and token refresh

### ✅ AUTHENTICATION INTEGRATION COMPLETE (100%) - ALL PASSWORDS WORKING
- **Mandatory Login System**: App requires authentication before access
- **Role-Based Redirection**: Users automatically redirected to appropriate dashboards
